### How do I use plugins?

To use a plugin, simply download the folder and drag it into the plugins folder in src or use the plugin add command. To use the plugin add command, the plugin must have a files.txt file. then click on that file, click raw, and then copy the url. Then do `plugin add [url] [pluginname]` and it will even reload automatically for you. Thats it! example, doing `plugin add https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AJS-development/OgarUL-Plugin-Library/master/devtools-plugin/files.txt devtools` will add a plugin called devtools to your plugins.

### How do I create a plugin? Is there Documentation?

This is the fun part, creating your own plugins. There is an example plugin you should look at and there is a template plugin. Currently, there is no documentation, but will be soon in the wiki
